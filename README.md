***Step to Run project download from github: First go to the github link, then click the Code option from the right side of the repository and then click Download Zip. After the download is completed , extract the download file here. Then open any IDE but here I used Eclipse. After opening the IDE , then click the “File” option and again click import. Here we expand the “General” option and click “Projects from Folder or Archive” option as well as click Next button. A new dialog window opens and here we click the “Directory” option and select the extracted file and click Finish button. The project arrived in the IDE and the extract src/test/java and the extract exceltechonologistltdhw named package and click SmartCarePro.java file. After the file opens then click Run All or run from Run option from IDE. In my video I will perform all steps and run the code.
